Assignment Submission Application (Coderevieweving application)

The application is using Java back-end, React front-end and MySQL database.

Suppose that you have a project coming up and there are programmers (employees) and codereviewers, who check the assignments that are agreed upon the project development meetings.
Employee can create an assignment. Assignment view comes up and employee needs to choose the assignment number github repo and a branch. At that time the assignment is in Pending Submission.
If assignment is created, it shows up in the codereviewer "Waiting for Review" section. Coderev needs to sign it to himself. After pushing "Claim" the assignment moves up to "In Review" section.
If everything is correct, the coderev can mark it as completed or reject assignment for a review. If assignment is completed, the badge shows completed in green but if it's rejected, the badge is going to show needs update in red.
There's also an option to comment on the assignment. The creator of the comment can edit or delete only it's own comments.
